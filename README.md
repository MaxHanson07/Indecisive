# Indecisive

With everything going on in the world right now, our brains are being pushed to the limit with the amount of information and decisions we need to make everyday. It seems that one of our only respites has also become another decision-making requirement: What movie to watch to relax and zone out to.  This seemingly simple action can take up to 30-45min and cause unwanted frustration.  Let us take that burden off you with nDecisive!
Select from our simple filters (or don't) and let us find the movie for you!  Wanna watch a Burt Reynolds film? Boom, done!  In the mood for a good drama, but don't know what to pick?  Boom, done!  Any type of film you are in the mood for, nDecisive will find an option for you.  If you don't like the option, search again; there is no limit.
